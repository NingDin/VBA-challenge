The Challenge is completed via following procedure:

1.Clarify the goal
2.Break down the tasks
3.optimize the flow -make the most of sense- have multiple solution and pick the optimize one
4.identify the key operation; use less loops;variable;less checkout to reduce run time
5.observe the data table/value and data structure and relation
6.take advantage of built- in logic-eg. Data relation; sequence; natural breaker--reduce run time
7.come up with the key task will perform again and again
8.searching the function within existing laboratory
9.assign the hierarchy of the task.
10.starting from the lower level and task block by block.
·         Breaker
·         Debug. For VBA
·         Open window
·         Immediate window
·         Bring in the value task each variable
11.compare/test the result and further optimze
